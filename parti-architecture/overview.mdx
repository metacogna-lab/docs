Parti Architecture is a multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized AI agents to generate complete software architecture specifications, from product requirements to deployment configurations.

## Agent System

The system consists of 7 specialized agents plus a supervisor:

1. **PRD Agent** - Product Requirements Document generation
2. **Data Agent** - Data modeling and schema design
3. **Design Agent** - UI/UX design system and tokens
4. **Logic Agent** - Business logic and workflows
5. **API Agent** - REST/GraphQL API specifications
6. **Frontend Agent** - React component architecture
7. **Deployment Agent** - Infrastructure and CI/CD pipelines

## Execution Phases

The system executes through sequential phases:

1. **PRD** - Product requirements and user stories
2. **Data** - Entity models and relationships
3. **Design** - Design system and UI tokens
4. **Logic** - Business rules and workflows
5. **API** - API endpoints and schemas
6. **Frontend** - Component hierarchy and state management
7. **Deployment** - Infrastructure and deployment configs

## Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Strategic interrupt points allow human review:

- **After PRD** - Review requirements before data modeling
- **After Logic** - Review business rules before API design
- **After API** - Review API spec before frontend implementation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Bun** (recommended) or Node.js
- **Cloudflare Account** with Workers access
- **Gemini API Key** (for agent execution)

### Installation

```bash
cd parit-architecture
bun install
```

### Environment Setup

Create `.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-key
```

### Development

```bash
# Start frontend
bun run dev

# Deploy all workers
bun run deploy:all
```
