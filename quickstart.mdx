## Welcome to MetaCogna

We build systems that think about thinking. The MetaCogna Suite is a collection of cognitive tools, architectures, and agents designed to augment human reasoning through structured intelligence.

Our work begins with a simple question: **Why?**

## Start Here

Choose your entry point based on what you're building:

  <Card title="Gateway API" icon="route" href="/gateway-api/overview">
    Central authentication and routing for all MetaCogna services. Start here if you're integrating with our infrastructure.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="MetaCogna RAG" icon="brain" href="/metacogna-rag/overview">
    Retrieval-Augmented Generation system with knowledge graphs, document management, and multi-agent reasoning.
  </Card>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 19+** or **Bun** (recommended)
- Git
- Cloudflare account (for deploying workers)

### Installation

Clone the MetaCogna Suite repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metacogna-lab/metacogna-suite.git
cd metacogna-suite
```

### Running Documentation Locally

This documentation site runs on Mintlify. To preview changes:

```bash
# Install Mintlify CLI
npm i -g mint

# Navigate to docs directory
cd docs

# Start development server
mint dev
```

Your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

<Tip>
The preview updates automatically as you edit files. No refresh needed.

## Core Concepts

Before diving deeper, understand these foundational ideas:

### Systems, Not Personalities

We treat thinking as a **system**, not a personality trait. Our architectures, agents, and tools are designed to augment cognitive processes through structured interactions.

### Paper UI Philosophy

Our design system follows three principles:

1. **Digital Paper** - Elements are physical sheets layered on a surface
2. **Hard Edges** - Minimal border radius (max 2px)
3. **High Contrast** - Strict polarity between Ink (dark) and Paper (light)

### Multi-Agent Architecture

Many MetaCogna systems use agent-based architectures where specialized agents coordinate, critique, and synthesize information—mirroring human metacognitive processes.

## Philosophy

MetaCogna Labs is intentionally small. That is not a limitation; it is a feature. It allows fast iteration without institutional drag, and lets ideas be tested before they harden into dogma.

We are motivated by:
- The quiet awe of the universe
- The strange joy of discovering how things really behave  
- The belief that better thinking leads to better outcomes
