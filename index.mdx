## Thinking About Thinking

MetaCogna builds systems that think about thinking. We are motivated by the quiet awe of the universe, the strange joy of discovering how things really behave, and the belief that better thinking leads to better outcomes.

## The MetaCogna Suite

A collection of cognitive tools, architectures, and agents designed to augment human reasoning through structured intelligence.

## Philosophy

We treat thinking as a **system**, not a personality trait. MetaCogna Labs is intentionally small. That is not a limitation; it is a feature. It allows fast iteration without institutional drag, and lets ideas be tested before they harden into dogma.

Our systems operate on principles of:
- **Visible Construction** - Metadata, IDs, and technical details are visible UI elements
- **Hard Edges** - Minimal border radius, clear boundaries, defined structures
- **High Contrast** - Strict polarity between concepts, clear hierarchies
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Specialized agents that critique, synthesize, and build upon ideas

## Core Concepts

### Systems Architecture

MetaCogna systems are built on Cloudflare Workers, using:
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based access control
- **Service Bindings** - Secure inter-worker communication
- **R2 Storage** - Object storage for documents and assets
- **D1 Databases** - Serverless SQLite for structured data
- **Vectorize** - Vector databases for semantic search

### Cognitive Augmentation

Our tools enhance reasoning through:
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** - Context-aware responses from knowledge bases
- **Knowledge Graphs** - Entity and relationship extraction
- **Multi-Agent Systems** - Coordinated, specialized agents with distinct roles
- **Metacognitive Simulation** - Systems that think about their own thinking processes
